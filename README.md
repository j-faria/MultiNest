MultiNest
=========

Efficient and Robust Bayesian Inference
---------------------------------------


MultiNest is a Bayesian inference tool which calculates the evidence and explores the parameter space which may 
contain multiple posterior modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in moderately high dimensions.

Language Support
----------------

MultiNest is written in Fortran 90 but wrappers & in the case of Matlab a native language implementation, 
is available for likelihood and prior functions written in following languages:

C/C++: wrappers provided with MultiNest package
R: RMultiNest, wrapper for MultiNest written by Johannes Buchner.
Python: PyMultiNest, wrapper for MultiNest written by Johannes Buchner.
Matlab: MatlabMultiNest written by Matthew Pitkin & Joe Romano, is a Matlab implementation of the algorithm 
        described in arXiv:0809.3437, although it lacks a few features included in the original Fortran 
        version of MultiNest. It can be downloaded from the files section of 
        [this website](http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/).
Read the MultiNest README file for more details.
 

Plotting & Visualisation
------------------------

GetDist: Output files produced by MultiNest are compatible with GetDist? plotting package which is part of CosmoMC.
SuperPlot: written by Andrew Fowlie, can calculate and plot posterior distributions, profile likelihoods, 
           confidence intervals, credible regions etc. from MultiNest output files.
PyMultiNest: has support for analysing the output from MultiNest & monitoring the progress.
